# PWA Setup Guide

Your Gastro-Elite app has been converted to a Progressive Web App (PWA)! Here's what was added and how to complete the setup:

## What was added:

1. **manifest.json** - PWA configuration file
2. **service-worker.js** - Offline functionality and caching
3. **Updated layout.tsx** - Service worker registration and manifest linking
4. **Icon generation script** - Helper to create PWA icons

## To complete the PWA setup:

### 1. Create PWA Icons
You need to create two PNG icon files:

- `public/icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `public/icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

**Quick setup:**
```bash
# Run the icon generation helper
node generate-icons.js

# Or manually create icons using your existing logo.svg
# Use online tools like:
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
# - https://convertio.co/svg-png/
```

### 2. Test PWA Installation

#### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):
1. Start your app: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in Chrome/Edge
3. Look for the "Install" button in the address bar
4. Click "Install" to add to desktop

#### On Mobile (Android Chrome):
1. Open your app in Chrome
2. Tap the menu (3 dots) → "Add to Home screen"
3. Follow the prompts to install

#### On Mobile (iOS Safari):
1. Open your app in Safari
2. Tap the Share button → "Add to Home Screen"
3. Follow the prompts to install

### 3. PWA Features

Your app now includes:
- ✅ **Offline functionality** - Works without internet
- ✅ **App-like experience** - Standalone display mode
- ✅ **Installable** - Can be installed on devices
- ✅ **Caching** - Fast loading from cache
- ✅ **Auto-updates** - Updates when new versions are available

### 4. Testing Offline Mode

1. Install the PWA on your device
2. Open the installed app
3. Turn off your internet connection
4. The app should still work (cached pages will load)

### 5. Customization

The PWA uses your app's existing colors and branding:
- Background: #A0A0A0 (matches your app)
- Theme: #A0A0A0 (matches your app)
- Name: "Gastro-Elite"
- Description: "Professional recipe management for hospitality"

## Troubleshooting

If the PWA doesn't install:
1. Make sure you have the icon files (icon-192.png and icon-512.png)
2. Check browser console for service worker errors
3. Ensure you're using HTTPS in production (required for PWA)
4. Test in Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest

## Production Deployment

For production, make sure to:
1. Deploy with HTTPS (required for PWA)
2. Test the install prompt on real devices
3. Verify offline functionality works
4. Check that the manifest.json is accessible at `/manifest.json`
